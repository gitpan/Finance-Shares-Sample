Finance/Shares/MySQL
====================

This module holds a series of stock quotes obtained from Finance::Shares::MySQL.
It makes this data available for the other modelling Finance::Share modules and
provides facilities for graphing the results using PostScript::Graph::Stock.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Date::Pcalc
  PostScript::Graph::Style
  PostScript::Graph::Stock
  Finance::Shares::Log
  Finance::Shares::MySQL

TESTING

The automated tests are minimal.  The 't' directory has some scripts which you
may trim to your setup.  There is no real way of testing this module without
having a mysql database available for the Finance::Shares::MySQL module to
interact with.  I would be grateful for any ideas on this or any other matter.
